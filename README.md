# Sensory Visual System for Cuayollotl Cognitive Architecture

This is the implementation of the Sensory Visual System. The article that describes this system can be found in:

[Computational framework of the visual sensory system based on neuroscientific evidence of the ventral pathway](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/364745655_Computational_framework_of_the_visual_sensory_system_based_on_neuroscientific_evidence_of_the_ventral_pathway)

Also, you can go to the **wiki** to see the documentation: [Wiki](https://github.com/LuisHumanoide/Sensory-Visual-System/wiki)

# Requeriments
•	Windows

•	Java

•	Java SDK: The system needs to be run from the environment

•	NetBeans: Version 13 is recommended

•	OpenCV: The system uses a dll, the file is "opencv_java455.dll" and is in the root folder of the project. https://opencv.org/

•	opencv-455.jar

•	kmiddle.jar: Middleware jar library.

# Installation

First, it is necessary to go to the GitHub site, clone the project or download it. The address at which the project is located is as follows:

https://github.com/LuisHumanoide/MiddlewareVision

After that, the project must be opened in the NetBeans environment; it has not yet been tested if the project can be imported without problems in other environments. NetBeans can be found at:

https://netbeans.apache.org/download/index.html

Once loaded into NetBeans, the project should run smoothly.


# Running the project

Once the project is downloaded in Netbeans, if the requirements are met, the system can be run

The GUI of the system is the following:

* **Original image visualizer:** Displays the original image in a square resolution; the image in this version is resized to this aspect ratio since operations need the arrays to have this relationship. It will then be modified to adopt any aspect ratio.

Monocular or binocular images can be displayed.

* **Animation controls:** They allow you to control if the sequence is going to animate, which can go forward or backward, in addition to being able to move to the following image or the previous one. Also, the frame rate per time unit of time can be adjusted to go faster or slower.

* **Tab panel:** It shows several tabs; the first tab corresponds to the folder selector, the second to the controls to adjust brightness, contrast, and other values; Finally, the third corresponds to the additional tools that serve to create convolution filters and configure the system.

* **Activation viewer:** Displays the array of images corresponding to the activations generated by the visual system.

* **Navigation buttons:** They are used to navigate in the activation viewer since the arrangement of images can be extensive, and it is convenient to display all the images on one screen.
